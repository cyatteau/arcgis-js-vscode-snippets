## Get started

### Prerequisites

To use this extension you will need to install:
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (version 1.35 or higher).
2. The extension. There are two possibilities:
    - From the [Visual Studio Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Esri.arcgis-jsapi-snippets).
    - Using the ***[Install from VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix)*** command in Visual Studio Code then import the [arcgis-jsapi-snippets-1.0.0.vsix](./arcgis-jsapi-snippets-1.0.0.vsix) file.

### Usage

After installing, there are two ways to use it:

**Option 1**) Using [built-in VS Code Intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript#_intellisense):
1. Start typing the prefix for the code snippet.
2. Select the snippet by pressing `Tab` or `Enter` key.

> **Notes:**
> - Make sure to have `"editor.tabCompletion": "on"` in the settings (`Preferences` > `Open Settings(JSON)`)
> - If pressing Tab doesn't work then you might have several snippets with the same prefix. Press `Ctrl-Space` (`Cmd-Space` on mac) to select the one you need.
>
> Read more about this feature in the official [VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).

---

**Option 2**) Installing the [Snippet Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RandomFractalsInc.snippets-viewer) extension

This extension adds a new option to the activity bar that lets you quickly browse and insert built-in and custom snippets:

### Configuration

If you want to create you own custom snippets you can do so. Read [about User defined snippets in Visual Studio official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets).

If you do so, please consider [contributing to this repository](#contributing) or join [other developers sharing their snippets](#community-snippets).
